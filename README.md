This repository consists of the AI (Claude Sonnet 3.7) generated report, in which I used the prompt:
Please write a well-structured academic report analyzing South Africaâ€™s price stability through the inflation rate (% change in CPI) from 2020 to 2025. The report should include an abstract, introduction, methodology, findings, discussion, and conclusion. Analyze inflation trends, policy responses, the impact of COVID-19, and compare outcomes with inflation targets. Use formal academic language, include relevant graphs or tables, and follow the Harvard referencing style with proper in-text citations. Address data limitations, especially for estimates beyond October 2024. Support all claims with evidence from reputable sources and maintain a logical, analytical tone throughout to reflect academic rigor.
